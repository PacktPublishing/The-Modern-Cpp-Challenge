# The Modern C++ Challenge
This is the code repository for [The Modern C++ Challenge](https://www.packtpub.com/product/the-modern-c-challenge/9781788993869), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
C++ is one of the most widely-used programming languages and has applications in a variety of fields, such as gaming, GUI programming, and operating systems, to name a few. Through the years, C++ has evolved into (and remains) one of the top choices for software developers worldwide. This book will show you some notable C++ features and how to implement them to meet your application needs. Each problem is unique and doesn't just test your knowledge of the language; it tests your ability to think out of the box and come up with the best solutions. With varying levels of difficulty, you'll be faced with a wide variety of challenges. And in case you're stumped, you don't have to worry: we've got the best solutions to the problems in the book. So are you up for the challenge?

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
}
```

As previously mentioned, you need a basic familiarity with the C++ language and the standard library in order to be able to utilize this book, or you can learn that along the way. In any case, this book will teach you how to solve problems, but it will not teach you about the language and features utilized in the solutions. You will need a compiler with C++17 support; a complete list of required libraries as well as possible compilers you can use can be found in the Software Hardware List available in the code bundle. In the following sections, you will find detailed instructions for downloading and building the code from this book.

## Errata
* The correct implementation for the postfix operator++ is as follows:
```
ipv4 operator++(int)
{
   ipv4 result(*this);
   ++(*this);
   return result;
}
```
* Page 250: The first line of the second code block must be read as "std::vector encoder::from_base64(std::string data)" instead of "std::vector encored::from_base64(std::string data)".
